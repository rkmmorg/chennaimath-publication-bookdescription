Devapuja or worship of God in and through an idol, either at home or in temples, is a common practice in the Hindu society. Though millions of Hindus all over the country visit temples, witness or participate in such ceremonies, very few are aware of the philosophy behind it.
This booklet by Swami Harshananda, a senior monk of the Ramakrishna Order, expounds in a simple language the philosophy behind the puja or worship and its significance. Also, a simple but practical procedure of a typical puja is given in the appendix as a model. This booklet will help readers understand the philosophy and the rationale behind the puja.
