Vedanta is often equated exclusively to Advaita Vedanta of Sri Sankaracharya, but there are several other acharyas who have expounded the Vedanta in quite a different way and whose status as teachers of Vedanta requires recognition.

This book by Swami Tapasyananda, a scholar-monk and former vice-president of the Ramakrishna Order, expounds the life and philosophy of Sri Chaitanya, whose illustrious disciples formed a distinctive set of metaphysics and theology around his teachings that came to be known as Achintya-bhedabheda philosophy. This book will help readers acquaint themselves with his devotional life and the fundamental concepts of Vedanta as formulated by his disciples based on his teachings.
