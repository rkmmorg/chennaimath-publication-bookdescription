Bhagavad Gita is an epic poem, an exposition of the Vedanta philosophy and a Gospel put together in one. This book by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood is an interpretation of the Gita taking these myriad aspects into account. In this interpretation, the translators have used the commentaries of Shankara, Sridhara Swami and Madhusudana Saraswati and also Essays on the Gita by Sri Aurobindo. This book serves as a unique reference in the study of Gita. *This book is for sale in India only and cannot be exported.

Reviews
......A distinguished literary work.
—Time (U.S.A.)

For those who are willing to give the introduction and appendix the study they deserve, this version of the Gita is probably the best available. —Times of India.

We are now offered a readable, agreeable and heterodox version of the Gita, not a literal translation, nor all in verse.
