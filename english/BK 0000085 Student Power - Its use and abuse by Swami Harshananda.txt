This booklet by Swami Harshananda, a senior monk of the Ramakrishna Order, discusses briefly the use and abuse of student's power. Student's power is felt intensely on both fronts, one from the negative side, in agitations spiraling into violence in college campuses, and another from the positive side, in volunteering for communal activities, spreading literacy and awareness on health and sanitation in rural areas etc. The author has surveyed the maladies that grip the student community and the need to train students properly to bring the best out of them.
