Written in the form of a dialogue between the youth, Nachiketa, and Yama, the God of Death, this time-honored teaching presents us with a simple, yet profound wisdom.

Selected from the multi-volume The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, the book presents Vivekananda's exposition of the Katha Upanishad. The compilation juxtaposes what Swamiji said in different contexts with the original verses of the Upanishad. The verses are given in the original Sanskrit, and transliterated,and  translated into English through Swami Vivekananda's commentary.
