This book is a compilation of some selected verses of the Katha Upanishad on which Swami Vivekananda had commented or explained either in his talks or in his writings.

The text has original verses in Sanskrit, their transliterations, and Swamiji?s exposition of these verses, coherently arranged culling out from the nine volumes of The Complete Works.

The compiler of this work is Swami Suprajnananda, a monk of Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai. The book is interspersed with beautiful sketches by Sri Venkatesh for the eyes to feast.

The contents were serially published in the Vedanta Kesari, the English monthly of the Math, from February 2011 to May 2012.
