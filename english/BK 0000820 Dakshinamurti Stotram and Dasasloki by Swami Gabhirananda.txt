Sri Shankaracharya's Dakshinamurthy Stotram is a hymn to Shiva, explaining metaphysics of the universe in the frame of the tradition of Advaita Vedanta. In a compilation of ten stanzas there is a concise and vivid description of the philosophical significance of the form of Siva, giving the very essence of the Indian idea of epistemology.

The Dashashloki or Ten verses on the Atman is considered by many in the traditional circles as the last pronouncement of Sri Shankaracharya on the subject to his intimate disciples.

This booklet is a simple translation of Sri Dakshinamurtistotram and Dashashloki by Swami Gabhirananda. The translation in English will help readers appreciate these poetic masterpieces and also understand the philosophical import it carries.
