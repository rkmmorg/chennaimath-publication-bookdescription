The Chandogya Upanishad forms the last chapter of the Chandogya Brahmana of the Sama Veda.It is the second largest of the major Upanishads, next only to the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad.  Shankara held this Upanishad in great esteem and quoted from it in his bhasya of the Brahma Sutras.
This edition by Swami Swahananda contains the original text with word for word meaning, running English translation and copious notes. In interpreting the text, the commentary of Sri Sankara has been systematically followed, mainly in the light of the Gloss by Anandagiri.
