Although many temples have been built in India and elsewhere for more than thousand years, not many people know about the grand science and philosophy behind their construction. This book written by Sri G.Venkataramana Reddy (Architect of many of Ramakrishna Universal Temples) attempts to present the principles and practices of Hindu temple construction in a systematic and clear manner. It aims at providing a comprehensive idea of how a Hindu temple is truly a house of God facilitating a devotee to worship and adore HIM and invoke a sense of holiness in his life. The philosophical import according to the Shastras is that the physical body of every being is in itself an Alayam (Temple) and the deity dwelling therein as its Lord is a representation of the Atman (soul).
