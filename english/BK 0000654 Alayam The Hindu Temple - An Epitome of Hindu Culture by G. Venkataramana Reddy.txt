This book attempts to present the principles and practices of Hindu temple construction in a simple manner. While temples have been built in India and elsewhere for millennia, not, not many people know about the grand science and philosophy behind their construction. At the back of the concrete structure and design of a temple stands a subtle and lofty ideal, affirming the presence of the Ultimate Truth, in a symbolic and tangible manner.
