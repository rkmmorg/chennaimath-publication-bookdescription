Vedanta is often equated exclusively to Advaita Vedanta of Sri Shankaracharya, but there are several other acharyas who have expounded the Vedanta in quite a different way and whose status as teachers of Vedanta requires recognition.
This book by Swami Tapasyananda, a scholar-monk and former vice-president of the Ramakrishna Order, expounds the life and philosophy of Sri Ramanuja, whose philosophy, Vishishthadvaita, is the most pre-eminent among the Bhakti schools of Vedanta. This book will help readers to briefly acquaint themselves with his celebrated life and understand the fundamental concepts of Vedanta as elucidated by him.
